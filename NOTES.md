# REACT Portfolio Project Notes

This personal portfolio website was made following this [tutorial by PedroTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7mwVn2z3Sk&ab_channel=PedroTech). 

This is my first personal project involving React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. My intentions with following this tutorial was to gain basic knowledge and hands-on practice with React, and familiarize myself with web development. This md acts as my own "lecture notes" and a document to keep track of my progress.

* Created this md.
* Imported useState from React to keep track of ReorderIcon state in the responsive mobile form. expandNavbar initially set to false, and then is changed states based on the onClick function which switches its state.
* Imported useEffect from React for a better UX experience. It ensures that the navbar closes automatically (as the state is set to false), whenever the location (hook) changes.
  
  ### _**Topics covered / learned:**_ 
  * introduction to [React hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react). (useState, useLocation, useEffect).
  * Implementation of onClick state function logic for navbar.
